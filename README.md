# Qub3d Engine Group: Development Docs

## Building

This repository uses Sphinx. For more information on Sphinx, see

If you're on a UNIX system and have Sphinx installed, you can simply run
`make`, pick the format you want from make's output, and run it. All this
needs to be in a user-created `build` directory.
