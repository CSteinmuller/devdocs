There are other files that go beyond this guide
in some fields, such as the Contributors' Guide
and the Documentation Howto. This guide is just
to help us get ready for getting our hands dirty

the Qub3d Engine Group and its tools. In this guide,
we give a brief introduction on each tool used in the
Qub3d project, and the Qub3d Engine Group and all of its
participating members.
