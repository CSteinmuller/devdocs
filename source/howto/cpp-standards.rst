This file is dedicated to the official
standards for C++ code formatting provided
by the Qub3d Engine Group that is also compliant
with ISO and compiler standards.

The current standard for C++ in use by
the Qub3d Engine Group is C++14.


Format Standards
==============================

This section consists of C++ format standards
that you must comply with in order to
contribute code to the Qub3d engine/launcher.


Localization
-------------

The code must be written in ASCII.
We use the English ASCII localization standard for
writing C++. Strings may be in unicode, preferably
UTF-16, unless you insert a unicode character
that ASCII doesn't support. For more information
on which characters are supported by ASCII, see
`the tables <http://www.asciitable.com/>`_.
