Welcome to the Official Qub³d Getting Started Guide!

The aim of this guide is to familiarize new users to the Qub³d Engine Group and 
its tools. In this guide, we give a brief introduction on each tool used in the
Qub³d project, and the Qub³d Engine Group and all of its participating members. 
If you appreciate this project enough to contribute, then please read the 
Contributors' Guide.

The simplest way to get started with Qub³d is to join the 
`official Discord Server <https://discord.gg/yv7FN24>`_.

We also have an official IRC channel on freenode: #qub3d.

If you have any issues that just don't quite fit inside Discord or IRC, don't 
fret! We have a mailing list address: yo@qub3d.org where you can send questions 
that don't contain spam/inappropriate/irrelevant content. This email is *only* 
used for questions.

There are other guides/howtos that go beyond this guide in some fields, such as 
the Contributors' Guide and the Documentation Guide. This guide is just to help 
you get ready for getting our hands dirty with the Qub³d repositories.
